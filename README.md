LangChain / AutoGPT : Ad Copy Generator

This is a sample code I created while experimenting with LangChain and Prompt Engineering on my local computer.
It intends to showcase a streamlit app built using LangChain that will act as a marketing expert and generate an ad copy based on user-defined headline. This also takes into consideration a wikipedia research and uses the concept of Chains to first create an ad description and then takes the headline & ad description both to come up with ad copy.

This might be a good use case for a Search Engine Marketing team that is considering to leverage an AI capability into their existing ad copy generation process workflow. Kindly note that, it is always advisable to look into legalese of your organization. I would highly recommend looking into Reponsible AI development, if you are just beginning your joruney with LLMs. While this is an example code, the ad copy output generated by this code may / may not represent your brand/client's marketing execution in its truest form, a little fine-tuning goes a long way. This code isn't built on any organization or client that I currently work with.
